    Patch from Glen Whitney
    
    A priori, there is no reason why the workspace warping functionality should
    treat the horizontal and vertical directions at all differently. Even if
    traditionally horizontal warping was more common, for some in recent times
    as aspect ratios tend to become larger, stacking virtual workspaces
    vertically may make more sense. Similarly, some might want to traverse
    an array of workspaces in column-major, rather than row-major, order.
    
    Prior to this commit, there were extra parameters for vertical warping (a
    controlling flag and an offset for how many workspaces to jump) as opposed
    to horizontal warping. Also it was impossible to allow vertical warping while
    disallowing vertical warping.
    
    This commit makes all of the parameters and behavior for horizontal and
    vertical warping equivalent. For backwards compatibility, there is an
    overarching flag controlling whether warping occurs at all, as well as a
    separate control flag and offset for each of horizontal and vertical warping.
    
    The relevant init file resources and default values are:
    
    session.screen0.workspaceWarping: true
    session.screen0.workspaceWarpingHorizontal: true
    session.screen0.workspaceWarpingVertical: true
    session.screen0.workspaceWarpingHorizontalOffset: 1
    session.screen0.workspaceWarpingVerticalOffset: 1

    Adds (secret) opaque resize mode. It sure would be nice if it was documented....
    
    The relevant init file resources and their default values are:
    
    session.screen0.opaqueResize: False
    session.screen0.opaqueResizeDelay: 40

    Having:
    
        session.screen0.strftimeFormat:     %d-%m-%y %02k:%M
    
    The switch[1] between 12H and 24H did not work due to the digits (02).

    Patch from Bo Simonsen.
    
    Max size per client (setMaxSizePerClient) was computed for
    iconbar.alignment = Relative not taking into account that a fixed size
    can be given when iconbar.alignment = Left/Right.
    
    In a "recent" change, relative alignment was changed, to better handle
    items with long titles. This is breaking existing behavior, the new
    behavior is (with this commit) now denoted RelativeSmart.

    Handle sizehint base_width / base_height being less than 0
    
    Some applications supply -1 in base_width / base_height. One example is
    the Preferences dialog of pcmanfm-qt:
    
    WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):
      ...
      program specified base size: -1 by -1
    
    Without this commit the program will crash due to overflow of unsigned int.
